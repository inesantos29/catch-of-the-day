# Catch of the day
Project in React Js from course https://reactforbeginners.com/ - Wes Bos 🔥 

Building real world React.js + Firebase apps and website components.

“Catch of the Day” — a real-time app for a trendy seafood market where price and quantity available are variable and can change at a moment's notice. We will build a menu, an order form, and an inventory management area where authorized users can immediately update product details.
